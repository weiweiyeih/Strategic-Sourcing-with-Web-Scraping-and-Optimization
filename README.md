# Strategic Sourcing with Web Scraping and Optimization

This project demonstrates the application of web scraping and linear programming to enhance decision-making in procurement and supply chain management. By automating data extraction from supplier websites and optimizing sourcing strategies, businesses can streamline operations and make informed, data-driven choices.

## Project Overview

This project showcases two primary use cases that are highly relevant to procurement and supply chain professionals:

1. Web Scraping for Ingredient Sourcing: We demonstrate how to automate the extraction of product data (e.g., availability, price, and market trends) from Ingredient Brothers’ website using web scraping techniques.

2. Strategic Sourcing Optimization: Using linear programming, we optimize the sourcing strategy for Cocoa Liquor Chips, balancing factors like cost, quality, lead time, and freight cost across four supplier origins.

## The combination of these techniques allows businesses to:

- Gather real-time data from multiple suppliers.
- Compare pricing and availability.
- Optimize procurement decisions for cost, quality, and logistics.

## Features

- Automated data extraction using web scraping.
- Real-time product details from the target website.
- Linear programming to optimize sourcing strategy.
- Interactive sliders for manual input of cost, quality, lead time, and supply factors.
- Visualization of optimized sourcing decisions using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- `Python`: Core programming language.
- `Streamlit`: Web application framework for interactive UI.
- `BeautifulSoup`: Web scraping library to extract data.
- `Pandas`: Data analysis and manipulation.
- `PuLP`: Linear programming solver for optimization.
